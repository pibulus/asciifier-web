# üöÄ ASCIIFIER-WEB PROJECT HANDOVER

## Current Status
Project is **80% complete** and ready to be promoted from experiments ‚Üí active/apps

## What We Built (Session Summary)
- Revolutionary ASCII art web app with server-side terminal tools (Figlet + Lolcat)
- Modular theme system with tasteful palettes (no dusty library colors!)
- Vintage controls: GRAIN and SCAN sliders for CRT/film effects
- Real SVG noise texture (not CSS patterns)
- Theme dropdown with click-outside behavior
- All settings persist to localStorage

## Branch Status
Currently on: `theme-system-modular`
Main branch available for merging

## üéØ TODO: Make This a Proper Active Project

### 1. Project Setup
```bash
# Move from experiments to active/apps
cd ~/Projects/active
mkdir -p apps/asciifier
cp -r experiments/asciifier-web/* apps/asciifier/

# Go to new location
cd apps/asciifier
```

### 2. Git Repository Setup
```bash
# Initialize fresh repo
rm -rf .git
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "init: üé® ASCIIFIER - Turn anything into ASCII art"

# Create GitHub repo
gh repo create asciifier --public --description "Turn ANYTHING into text art - Server-side terminal magic in your browser" --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

### 3. Update CLAUDE.md
The CLAUDE.md needs updating with:
- Move status from "experiments" to "active/apps"
- Update the architecture description
- Document the theme system module (it's reusable!)
- Add deployment instructions

### 4. Run TINKER Template
Location: `~/Documents/reference/TINKER-template.md`

Key sections to fill:
- **WHAT**: ASCII art generator with server-side terminal tools
- **WHY**: Brings terminal magic to browsers, Gmail-pasteable
- **HOW**: Figlet + Lolcat running server-side via Deno/Fresh
- **STACK**: Deno, Fresh, Tailwind, SVG noise
- **REVENUE**: Could be $1 for HD exports or custom fonts

### 5. Project Ledger Update
```bash
# Add to PROJECT_LEDGER.json
{
  "asciifier": {
    "status": "active",
    "momentum": "hot",
    "ready_percentage": 80,
    "path": "active/apps/asciifier",
    "stack": "Deno/Fresh + Tailwind",
    "description": "ASCII art generator with terminal magic",
    "problems_solved": [
      "Convert images to ASCII art",
      "Gmail-pasteable colored text",
      "Terminal aesthetics in browser"
    ],
    "github_url": "https://github.com/pibulus/asciifier",
    "deploy_url": "https://asciifier.app",
    "commits_since_ship": 0,
    "last_touch": "2024-01-30",
    "revenue_model": "$1 HD exports",
    "blockers": [],
    "next_steps": [
      "Deploy to Deno Deploy",
      "Add more figlet fonts",
      "Image upload size limits"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 6. Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Deno Deploy
deno task build
deployctl deploy --production --project=asciifier

# Update DNS (if domain ready)
# asciifier.app ‚Üí Deno Deploy
```

### 7. Theme System Module
The `theme-system/` folder is **completely modular** and reusable!
Consider:
- Making it its own npm/deno package
- Using it in other Fresh projects
- It has grain/scan vintage controls built in!

### 8. Final Touches
- [ ] Add screenshot to README (use the screenshot automation workflow)
- [ ] Test on mobile (should work, it's responsive)
- [ ] Consider adding PWA manifest
- [ ] Add analytics if desired

## üé® Key Features to Highlight
1. **Server-side terminal tools** - Revolutionary approach!
2. **Modular theme system** - Reusable across projects
3. **Vintage controls** - Film grain + CRT scanlines
4. **Gmail compatibility** - Colored ASCII that pastes perfectly
5. **No-JS fallback** - Core features work without client JS

## üìù Architecture Notes
```
Server-side: Figlet + Lolcat (via npm in Deno)
     ‚Üì
API Routes: /api/figlet, /api/colorize
     ‚Üì
Client: Fresh Islands for interactivity
     ‚Üì
Output: HTML spans with inline styles (Gmail-safe)
```

## üö® Important Context
- This project pioneered the "server-side terminal tools in browser" approach
- The theme system is Pablo's new standard (vintage cream + terminal dusk)
- Grain uses real SVG turbulence noise (not patterns)
- Everything saves to localStorage
- The random theme generator has TASTE (no library browns!)

## Ready to Ship?
Almost! Just needs:
1. Move to active/apps
2. Deploy to production
3. Update all the tracking files
4. Maybe add a few more figlet fonts

This is a **flagship project** - it perfectly embodies the Pablo philosophy of bringing terminal magic to everyone with zero friction!
